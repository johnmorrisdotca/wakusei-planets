// What an element does with the data door: it keeps a view's sources (`sources`, `addSource`, `removeSource`, `enableSource`, the attribute `data="own"`), tells the page when the set of credited sources changes
// (`wakusei-creditschange`), and answers `credits()`. `<wakusei-body>` and `<wakusei-space>` both use it, so the two behave the same. Not part of the `/door` entry: it sends events, so it is for the elements.
